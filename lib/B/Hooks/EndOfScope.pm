=head1 SYNOPSIS

    on_scope_end { ... };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to execute code when perl finished compiling the
surrounding scope.

=func on_scope_end

    on_scope_end { ... };

    on_scope_end $code;

Registers C<$code> to be executed after the surrounding scope has been
compiled.

This is exported by default. See L<Sub::Exporter> on how to customize it.

=head1 PURE-PERL MODE CAVEAT

While L<Variable::Magic> has access to some very dark sorcery to make it
possible to throw an exception from within a callback, the pure-perl
implementation does not have access to these hacks. Therefore, what
would have been a compile-time exception is instead converted to a
warning, and your execution will continue as if the exception never
happened.

To explicitly request an XS (or PP) implementation one has two choices. Either
to import from the desired implementation explicitly:

 use B::Hooks::EndOfScope::XS
   or
 use B::Hooks::EndOfScope::PP

or by setting C<$ENV{B_HOOKS_ENDOFSCOPE_IMPLEMENTATION}> to either C<XS> or
C<PP>.
