  * Complete pure-perl implementation in addition to the one based on
    Variable::Magic. You can specify the implementation explicitly by
    use-ing B::Hooks::EndOfScope::PP or B::Hooks::EndOfScope::XS, or
    by setting $ENV{B_HOOKS_ENDOFSCOPE_IMPLEMENTATION} to either 'XS'
    or 'PP'
  * Switch from using Sub::Exporter to the more conservative
    Sub::Exporter::Progressive

  * A minor efficiency improvement.

0.10  Thu, 16 Feb 2012 09:41:54 +0100
  * Stop propagating our magic through localisation.

0.09  Fri, 07 May 2010 22:11:49 +0200
  * Improve distribution metadata.

0.08  Sun, 19 Apr 2009 19:15:44 +0200
  * Depend on Variable::Magic 0.34 so exceptions during compile time that
    trigger a destructor don't cause an exception on 5.10 anymore.

0.07  Fri, 20 Feb 2009 14:22:16 +0100
  * Depend on Variable::Magic 0.31 so exceptions thrown in on_scope_end
    blocks don't lose their error message.

0.06  Mon, 19 Jan 2009 00:51:45 +0100
  * Depend on Variable::Magic 0.27 to stop exceptions thrown in
    on_scope_end blocks from segfaulting. Also add a test for that.

0.05  Sun, 04 Jan 2009 20:46:07 +0100
  * Use Variable::Magic and cast %^H instead Scope::Guard and relying
    on a timely destruction of objects within %^H. This fixes using
    on_scope_end in blocks where string evals are compiled as those
    increment the refcount of objects in %^H on 5.10.

0.04  Mon, 20 Oct 2008 12:56:23 +0200
  * Remove an unused bit from the $^H mask.

0.03  Mon, 20 Oct 2008 06:53:20 +0200
  * Improve testing of multiple hooks.
  * More documentation.
  * Require perl 5.8.0.

0.02  Sun, 19 Oct 2008 10:25:15 +0200
  * Specify all dependencies.

0.01  Sun, 19 Oct 2008 09:29:13 +0200
  * Initial release.
